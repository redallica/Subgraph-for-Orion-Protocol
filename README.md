# Subgraph-for-Orion-Protocol
This is a subgraph for the [Orion Protocol](https://github.com/orionprotocol) token (**$ORN**)

This requires the Orion Token ($ORN) contract (address: *0x0258F474786DdFd37ABCE6df6BBb1Dd5dfC4434a*) to be ingested by the subgraph, with the events that were sourced to be stored in the subgraph database:

•	MinterRole.sol

     o	event MinterAdded
     
     o 	event MinterRemoved
     
•	IERC20.sol

     o	event Approval
     
     o	event Transfer
     
All of the other contracts don't emit events that are relevant for this subgraph.

This contract is running on Ethereum Mainnet. In order to do so the subgraph.yaml file will need to have the contract address (see above), the entities (defined in the GraphQL schema) and the event handlers.

## Brief Description of The Graph Node Setup

A Graph Node can run multiple subgraphs, and in this case it can have a subgraph for Ropsten, Mainnet and Kovan. The subgraph ingests event data by calling to Infura through http. It can also connect to any geth node or parity node that accepts RPC calls. Fast synced geth nodes work. To use parity, the --no-warp flag must be used. Setting up a local Ethereum node is more reliable and faster, but Infura is the easiest way to get started.

This subgraph has three types of files which tell the Graph Node to ingest events from specific contracts. They are:

•	The subgraph manifest (subgraph.yaml)

•	A GraphQL schema (schema.graphql)

•	Mapping scripts (mapping.ts)

This repository has these files created and ready to compile, so a user can start this subgraph on their own.

The Graph team has provided a quick guide on how to start up a graph node. If these steps aren't descriptive enough, the [getting started guide](https://github.com/graphprotocol/graph-node/blob/master/docs/getting-started.md) has in depth details on running a subgraph.

## Ingesting events from the Orion Protocol Contracts

This subgraph is ingesting **4 events** as described above:

•	Event Transfer from IERC20.sol: event *Transfer(address indexed from, address indexed to, uint256 value)* emitted when *‘value’* tokens are moved from one account (*‘from’*) to another (*‘to’*).

•	Event Approval from IERC20.sol: event *Approval(address indexed owner, address indexed spender, uint256 value)* emitted when the allowance of a *‘spender’* for an *‘owner’* is set by a call to *{approve}*. *‘value’* is the new allowance.

•	Event MinterAdded from MinterRole.sol: event *MinterAdded(address indexed account)* emitted when an account or a set of accounts are added with a permission to mint (create) new tokens. 

•	Event MinterRemoved from MinterRole.sol: event *MinterRemoved(address indexed account)* emitted when an account or a set of accounts with a permission to mint (create) new tokens are removed. 

## Steps to initiate and deploy The Orion Protocol Subgraph on the hosted service

1.	Sign in The Graph explorer with your Github account and click on ‘Add subgraph’.

2.	Create the Orion Protocol subgraph in The Graph explorer

3.	Install Node.js (https://nodejs.org/en/)

4.	Install Git (in this case we are using Windows OS) (https://gitforwindows.org/)

5.	Install Yarn and run `npm install -g npm` followed by `npm-windows-upgrade` if needed

6.	Install Graph CLI by running: `yarn global add @graphprotocol/graph-cli`. 

7.	Initiate the Orion protocol subgraph with: `graph init \ --from-contract 0x0258F474786DdFd37ABCE6df6BBb1Dd5dfC4434a /<Githubusername>/<Directory>`

8.	The initiated subgraph at this stage is not completed, it is just a sort of a template that you will need to update and complete.

9.	Update the manifest, schema and the mappings to reflect how the subgraph will ingest data.

10.	Now deploy the Orion Protocol subgraph to The Graph Node with `yarn deploy`. You should see a lot of blocks being skipped in the graph-node terminal, and then it will start ingesting events from the moment the contracts were uploaded to the network.

Now that you have subgraph is running you may open a [Graphiql](https://github.com/graphql/graphiql) browser at *127.0.0.1:8000* and get started with querying.
